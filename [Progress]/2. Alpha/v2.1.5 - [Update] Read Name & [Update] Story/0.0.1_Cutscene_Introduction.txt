[L]My name is %PlayerIG.name.
[R]I see... So your name is %PlayerIG.name...
[R]A name that goes very well for a "Summon".
[L]Wait... A summon? What do you mean?
[R]What does it mean? What a foolish question.
[R]It means that you have to obey me.
[R]Simple as that isn't it?
[R]I hope that you won't disappoint me.
[R]I will now send you to fulfill your destiny.
[L]My "Destiny"? What might it be?
[R]You do not have to know what it is.
[R]You will understand in due time.
[R]The day you will meet her...
[R]I will make you asleep now.
