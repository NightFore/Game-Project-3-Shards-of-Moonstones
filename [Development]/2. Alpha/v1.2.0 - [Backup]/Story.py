Wake up young child...

Huh...? Where am I?

Tell me your name.
And maybe I can answer you.

    (Enter Character Name)

That doesn't seem like a real name!
Please, tell me your name!

My name is %s.

I see... You're %s...
So my new Summon name is %s

Wh... What do you mean?"

It means that I will look after you.
But you will also have to obey me.
I hope you won't disappoint me.
I will send you off to accomplish // a important mission.

So what is that mission?"

You don't have to know about it.
You will understand when you will // have to do when you confront her.

You're going to fall asleep now.

Wolf LvL 2

# Introduction
Oh, there is another wolf there...
It's weird, it looked like he's guarding this area.
He's alone, I should be able to take him down easily.

Wait, there is another one!
Well, got no choice but to go through them...
Let's go!

# Victory
Phew... I'm beat.
Now, I should be near the village.
Let's see what's happening...

Wh...What!? The village is in fire!
What happened there?
I can see some people still trying to escape!
I have to rush over there and help them!

This wolf doesn't seem like the other one.
He looks way more bigger.
I should be more careful around him.

# Victory
Alright! I'll soon reach the village.
Let's keep up this pace!
These villagers need my people to escape such monsters like that.

Hey, that's quite a big pack of wolves!
I wonder if I'll be able to face all of them...
I'll need help but for now let's stop the ones that are standing before me.

# Victory
The more I approach the village, the more stronger they become...
I still hear the villagers screaming over there.
I need to hurry up and join them.

# Introduction
The air is blazing!
I hope we will be able to evacuate everyone.
Wait, someone over there is fighting a group of wolves!
I have to help him fight them!

Hey! Need my help over here!?
I'll help you take them down!

Yes! I'll gladly accept your offer!
My name is Iris, let's beat all of them out of the village!

# Victory
It was the last one of them!
Your precision with the bow is really amazing!
You were a great help!

No, I should be the one thanking you!
I wonder how I would've end up if you weren't there as a vanguard...
I don't really want to think about it though.

Lucky I rushed over here then I guess.

We've got other people to help.
Let's move on.

Yeah, you're right.
